# Installation
## Prerequisites
### Ensure you have NodeJS and Git installed

You can follow the instructions on the NodeJS website to install it : https://nodejs.org<br />
After installation, ensure you have installed build tools.
On Linux you can install it with this command:
```
$ apt-get install -y build-essential
```
On Windows you have to check a case in the installation program.

For Git, you can also follow the instructions on the Git website : https://git-scm.com/downloads

## Install Styx

**1. Run styx-install NPX script to install Styx**

Create a directory named "styx" where you want on your system.<br/>Now in the newly created directory type this command:
```
$ npx https://www.github.com/Nealll68/styx-install
```
This script will clone this repository, install packages, create needed files and build the application for you.
<br/>**Note**: if you want to use Yarn instead of NPM for packages, use flag : --yarn

To update Styx, go in the styx folder and type this command:
```
$ npx https://www.github.com/Nealll68/styx-install --update
```

**2. Configure Styx**

Before running the application you will need to update some variables in the **.env** file.
<br/>Here are the description of the different variables you can edit :
Name | Description
---- | -----------
HOST | IP of the host. Generally you don't need to edit this.
PORT | The port where the app will listen.
WS_URL | The URL for websocket. Use your IP or domain name, like : ws://YOUR_IP or ws://your-domain.com. If you use HTTPS, use wss:// instead of ws://
API_URL | The URL for the API. Generally you don't need to edit this.

**3. Launch Styx**

To launch Styx, in the styx folder you need to run this command:
```
$ npm run start
# or
$ yarn start
```
Now the interface is serving on the port 3000.

**4. Serve the application**

To make Styx accessible from outside you will need to open some ports and redirect some traffic. For that I recommend to follow these tutorials:<br/>

* For Linux (Debian based system):

**You can skip Step 2 and replace all hello.js with server.js in commands**<br/>
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-debian-10#step-1-‚Äî-installing-nodejs

* For Windows server:

I lost several hairs to install my application on Windows server, so i really recommend you Linux. But if you want to install it on windows, check this tutorial:<br/>
